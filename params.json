{"name":"Virtual Liquid Handler","tagline":"Web-based 3D simulation of laboratory liquid handlers","body":"This is a simulation tool for those who are working with **laboratory robots (liquid handlers)**\r\nof different makes. Using 3D animation, it simulates the work protocols (processes), visually showing\r\nhow the robots moves labware (such as 96-well PCR plates) around, how it transfers liquids from source\r\nto target wells etc. \r\n\r\nVLH is not bound to a specific hardware platform and _different liquid handlers_ hardware setups can be easily\r\nimplemented. \r\n\r\nIn the current implementation, it can be use for demonstration of the existing\r\nprotocols. The ultimate (currently very distant) aim is to create a tool which will use the current \r\n3D visualizer as a front-end, and different back-ends which will translate specific protocol implementations\r\non various real hardware into 3D-presentable VLH-runs. And vice-versa, it will allow for very intuitive\r\n3D-based programming, and convert the general code VLH-code into hardware-specific robot programming languages.\r\n\r\nThis software is implemented as a webapp in javascript and X3DOM (www.x3dom.org). It runs in a WebGL-supporting\r\nbrowser (tested in Firefox and Chrome).\r\n\r\nThe Virtual Liquid Handler has been originated by @igorhollaender and the LEXOGEN company (www.lexogen.com)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
